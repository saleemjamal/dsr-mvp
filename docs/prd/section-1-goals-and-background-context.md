# Section 1: Goals and Background Context

### Goals

Based on the comprehensive Project Brief, here are the desired outcomes this PRD will deliver if successful:

• Reduce manual data entry time by 75% (from 8 hours to 2 hours daily) across all stores within 3 months
• Achieve real-time performance visibility with <60 minute data freshness for business decisions  
• Implement intelligent variance detection system to catch >99% of discrepancies over ₹100 threshold
• Create seamless three-way reconciliation between POS API, manual entries, and bank statements
• Establish exception-based workflows that reduce AIC daily reconciliation from 3-4 hours to <1 hour
• Enable store managers to complete daily closing procedures in <30 minutes versus current 2 hours
• Deliver mobile-accessible performance dashboards for owners with same-day visibility
• Maintain existing DSR-MVP functionality while adding API-driven automation layer
• Provide predictive bank reconciliation capabilities for proactive cash management
• Scale retail operations without proportional increases in administrative overhead

### Background Context

This project addresses the critical "reconciliation black hole" plaguing multi-store retail operations, where disconnected systems force businesses to spend 7-8 combined hours daily attempting to match three separate data sources: POS systems, bank statements, and manual records. The current state results in 2-3 day cash position blindness and ₹50,000-200,000 annual losses from undetected variances.

The solution leverages a unique "Validation Layer Architecture" that transforms the existing DSR-MVP manual tender-entry system into a strategic advantage by creating intelligent validation between GoFrugal POS API data and manual tender-type breakdowns. This dual-source approach provides both real-time performance visibility AND granular cash management control - something pure API solutions cannot deliver. Building upon 90% complete cash management functionality in the existing DSR-MVP, this approach delivers immediate value while establishing the foundation for a comprehensive retail ERP system.

### Change Log

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|

### Key Assumptions

- GoFrugal API reliability and stability for real-time sync operations
- Store staff acceptance of continuing manual tender entry when validated automatically  
- ₹100 variance threshold appropriate across different transaction volumes
- Existing DSR-MVP codebase maintainable and extensible for new features
