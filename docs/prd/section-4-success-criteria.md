  - Target: 100%
  - Measurement: Training module completion

### Business Impact Metrics

**Revenue Enhancement (12-month):**
- **Revenue Growth:** 10% increase through better visibility
  - Baseline: Current growth rate
  - Target: +10% incremental
  - Measurement: Year-over-year comparison
- **Cost Reduction:** ₹50,000+ monthly savings in labor costs
  - Baseline: Current staff costs for manual work
  - Target: 75% reduction
  - Measurement: Hourly rate × hours saved
- **Loss Prevention:** 50% reduction in unexplained variances
  - Baseline: ₹5,000-50,000 monthly
  - Target: 50% reduction
  - Measurement: Monthly variance reports

**Operational Excellence:**
- **Month-End Closing:** Reduce from 10 hours to 2 hours
  - Baseline: 10+ hours
  - Target: 2 hours
  - Measurement: Time logs
- **Audit Compliance:** Zero GST penalties for tender misreporting
  - Baseline: ₹25,000+ annually
  - Target: Zero
  - Measurement: Penalty records
- **Multi-Store Scaling:** Support 10+ stores without additional AIC
  - Baseline: 1 AIC per 5-6 stores
  - Target: 1 AIC per 10+ stores
  - Measurement: Stores per AIC ratio

### Minimum Viable Success (MVP)

For the MVP to be considered successful, it must achieve:

**Non-negotiable Requirements:**
1. ✅ Correctly validate 100% of manual entries against API
2. ✅ Reduce daily reconciliation time by >50% in first month
3. ✅ Zero critical data loss or corruption incidents
4. ✅ All existing DSR functions continue working
5. ✅ AIC completes daily reconciliation in <1 hour

**Early Warning Indicators:**
- Variance detection accuracy <90% = Algorithm needs tuning
- User login frequency <80% = Adoption issues need addressing
- Sync failures >10% = API integration needs stabilization
- Support tickets >10 per store = Training or UX issues
