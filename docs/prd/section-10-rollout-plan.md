# Section 10: Rollout Plan

### Deployment Strategy

**Phase 0: Foundation (Week 1-2)**
- Set up GoFrugal API credentials and test endpoints
- Create parallel database tables for API data
- Deploy basic sync infrastructure
- Establish monitoring and alerting
- Document runbooks for common issues

**Phase 1: Pilot Stores (Week 3-6)**
- Select 2 pilot stores (1 high-volume, 1 standard)
- Deploy read-only dashboard with API data
- Run parallel with existing manual process
- Daily check-ins with pilot store managers
- Iterate based on feedback

**Phase 2: Validation Layer (Week 7-10)**
- Enable manual tender entry with validation
- Implement variance detection and alerting
- Train pilot store staff on validation workflow
- Monitor variance patterns and adjust thresholds
- Begin collecting reconciliation accuracy metrics

**Phase 3: Full Rollout (Week 11-16)**
- Gradual rollout to remaining stores (2-3 per week)
- Store-by-store training sessions
- AIC training on exception-based workflow
- Phased cutover from manual to system-driven process
- Daily war room for first week per store

- Variance detection accuracy >90%
- User satisfaction score >7/10

**Week 5-8 Metrics:**
- AIC reconciliation time <90 minutes
- Cash variance <1%
- Adoption rate >80%

**Week 9-12 Metrics:**
- Full workflow time reduction >50%
- All stores onboarded
- Positive ROI achieved

### Risk Mitigation

**Rollback Plan:**
- Maintain manual process in parallel for first month
- One-click export to Excel for fallback
- Daily backups with 15-minute recovery time
- Clear rollback criteria and decision matrix

**Support Structure:**
- Dedicated WhatsApp group for each store
- Daily standup during rollout period
- Video tutorials for common tasks
- FAQ document updated daily
- Escalation matrix for critical issues

### Communication Plan

**Pre-Launch (2 weeks before):**
- All-hands video call explaining changes
- Benefits-focused email to all users
- Training schedule announcement
- FAQ document distribution

**Launch Week:**
- Daily status emails
- Morning check-in calls with pilot stores
- End-of-day summary to stakeholders
- Quick win celebrations

**Post-Launch:**
- Weekly performance reports
- Monthly user feedback sessions
- Quarterly business review
- Success stories newsletter
